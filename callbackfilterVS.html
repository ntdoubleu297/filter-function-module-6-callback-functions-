        // and so what i want to do is, I want to be able to write a filter, as you can see here on line 11.  That will take a callback.
        //now the reason you might want to do this is that, you cannot foresee ahead of time all of the different ways in which someone might want to filter data.
        //they might not even have an array, they might have a collection of objects or they might have some other complicated data structure.
        //and so, how they are filtering, what criteria they are using, you cannot know ahead of time...
        //so if you provide the flexibility of allowing the user of your API to be able to provide a function, a callback function, then you can accomodate this capability without having to write all of the functionality. 
        

        //so as you can see here we have a couple of functions, 1 is the callback (line 7), the other one is the filter (line 11), and then, we call the filter...
        //as you can see with TWO PARAMETERS... function filter(list,callback){}....
        //the very FIRST PARAMETER is the very data we are acting on which is our 'list'...
        //the SECOND PARAMETER is the 'callback' function....
        //so lets go ahead and take a look at our 'callback' function...

        const list = [5,8,9,2,7,6,3,1,4];

        function callback(list) { //line 7 addition...a simple callback, we are going to filter this 'list' herein
            const newList = []; // so we will create a new variable for ourselves....we will call it 'newList' this will be an empty array.
            for (let i = 0, i < list.length, i++) { //and then we are going to create a for loop to simply move through the data, through the entire length of the list...and we will add a condition their to stop the loop once we have reached that length...
                if (list[i] < 5) { //now INSIDE OF THE LOOP we are going to have a condition where we're going to check to see simply the value of that number. with a condition to filter those that have a value of LESS THAN 5...
                newList.push(list[i]); // and now we will "push that item" into the new list via syntax....
             }
            
            }
            return newList;
        } //now all we have to do at this point is invoke that callback with the parameter....


        function filter (list, callback){  //so we will call the function....
            return callback(list);  //and we will pass the parameter, and we will return all of this to the line where it is invoked on line 22.
        
        }

        // so this is a pretty flexible mechanism and as you will see, there's a lot of structures within the language of Javascript that allow you to provide a callback function.
        // and we ill see that throughout the number of lessons that we will do on this topic...

        const filtered = filter(list, callback);
        console.log(filtered) // this to check and see the value on the browser console...
